Look around at social media, politics, or the news and you're likely to agree with the bodybuilding champ-turned-movie star-turned-governor of California.

Whether he was lifting weights for five hours a day or trying to hack a path through the thicket of California politics, Schwarzenegger claims he was consistently happy. What allowed him to maintain a positive outlook despite personal setbacks and tough jobs? In his book Be Useful, Schwarzenegger boils down his philosophy to just four words.

You might think a simple mantra is too flimsy a thing to be actually meaningful in the face of real-life struggle. But according to top psychologists, the Governator actually manages to capture profound truths about human flourishing in one quick motto.

## The Key Principles

1. **Focus on value, not price** - Understanding the difference between what something costs and what it's worth
2. **Long-term thinking** - Patience is a virtue in investing
3. **Stay within your circle of competence** - Know what you know and what you don't
4. **Be fearful when others are greedy** - Contrarian thinking pays off

These principles have guided Buffett through decades of successful investing and can be applied to many areas of life beyond finance.
