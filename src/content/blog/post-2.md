The web development landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Here are the key trends shaping how we build for the web in 2025.

## AI-Assisted Development

AI tools are becoming integral to the development workflow, from code completion to debugging and even architectural decisions.

## Edge Computing

Moving computation closer to users is becoming standard practice, with frameworks like Astro leading the charge in static-first approaches.

## Component Islands

The islands architecture, popularized by Astro, is gaining widespread adoption as developers seek better performance without sacrificing interactivity.

The future is bright for web developers who stay curious and adapt to these changes.
