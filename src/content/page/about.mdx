# Hey! We are Claire + Luke 

A couple navigating and learning about our neurodivergent brains! 

Claire here! In 2025, I launched Dopamine Decor Co, an interior design company catered to ADHD living and strategic design. I learned a lot about my own brain (and the ADHD + audhd experience), but got frustrated that I had so much more to share than just interior design “hacks”. While running DDC, friends and family started coming out of the woodwork, asking for my take on the nuance of the ND struggle other friends just wouldn’t understand. 

June 2024,  I released the ADHD Home Office Guide, created a meticulous and effective 8 week marketing campaign…and then had to table it all immediately to move unexpectedly. I lost all momentum for DDC. 

While I was working on DDC, Luke was working for Big 4, as a UX Design System Manager – it’s okay if you don’t know what that is, just know he was phenomenal at it, because his literally hobby is note taking systems. Yes, You read that correctly. (Cue the austim joke)

But here’s the thing, as the DDC community grew, and we unpacked our complex traumas as a couple, (and as we simply continue to exist in the world) we’ve come to realize how unique our thought processes and lived experiences are. 

Luke left Big 4 in October, now working for a tech startup and is learning more about his brain. We have lots of in depth conversations about our varied experiences acrossworking corporate, the tech, music, sustainability, design, and fitness industries, and thought that our discussions could also help a lot of you! While we all feel like our experiences are incredibly unique, at the end of the day, they arn’t and should be talked about more.q 

I’m writing this in the notes section on my phone, while on a flight to Vancouver, and Luke is next to me coding our website, (dopamineduo.com) where we can drop all of our resources for you. The ADHD Home Office Guide will be moved there as well. 

On this account, we will be sharing our ND experiences, how we manage it together as a couple, share resources that have helped us, and create some too! 

That’s enough about us, but we are so glad you’re here🖤
